\section{Share the entire project structure}

Every user should be able to see all changes to the project.
Based on this Issue and the discussion "Current implementation only shares current project. It would be more useful if I could share the whole project so two persons can work on different files."\footnote{\href{https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/211}{https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/211}} being able to edit the entire project structure is a very important feature.

\section{Only display changes in the same Git branch}

Given that a lot of developers are using prototype branches and a significant number are usign feature branches Git branches are a good indication that a specific problem is being worked on.\cite{PhillipsSillitoWalker:2011:Branching_and_merging} Therefore only displaying cuncurrent edits on the same edit removes noise of unrelated edits.

\section{Stage changes by author}

Synchronizing changes to all developers introduces a problem:
"[\dots]This means that git only becomes a way to have a backup as all the work is done using P2P! [\dots]"\footnote{\href{https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/211\#issuecomment-478306010}{https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/211\#issuecomment-478306010}}
Possibly unrelated modicications would be bundled into huge commits. In order to mitigate this, changes should be stageable by author.
